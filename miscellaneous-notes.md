#Strict Mode
_reference: <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strict.asp>_

Strict mode is declared by adding `"use strict";` to the beginning of a script or a function.
Declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope (all code in the script will execute in strict mode).

##What does it do?
Strict mode prevents you from using undeclared variables and will cause the compiler to throw an error if it sees one.

##Why?
Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" Javascript.
It changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.
